"Computer"
was originally a person who computed!

    Relay - an electrical device, typically incorporating an electromagnet, which is activated by a current or signal in one circuit to open
or close another circuit.

Harvard Mark 1 - Conceived by Harvard physics professor Howard Aiken, and designed and built by IBM, the Harvard Mark 1 is a room - sized,
    relay - based calculator.The machine had a fifty - foot long camshaft running the length of machine that synchronized
    the machineâ€™ s thousands of component parts and used 3, 500 relays .1944

    1947 - A moth was pulled from the Mark 1 "From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it" - Grace Hopper

"VACUUM TUBES" -
    "Diode" - Any electronic component that allows the one - way transmission of current
    Thermionic Valve - First Vacuum Tube - Thermionic Transmission - Fleming -
    "Vacuum Tubes" are like relays with one "GREAT" Exception - they have no moving parts.
    They are, however, fragile and can burn - out like lightbulbs, but they are a major improvement over mechanical relays
    They marked the transition from ELECTROMECHANICAL computing to ELECTRONIC Computing

"Colossus Mark 1" - First programmable, electronic computer. Built to decode Nazi Encryption
    Programming was done by plugging hundreds of wires into "Plugboards", sort of like old school telephone switchboards,
    in order to set up the computer to perform the right operation

"ENIAC" - first truly general purpose computer
===================================================
1947 - Bell Labs - "TRANSISTOR" was invented! physics behind transistors relies on quantum physics but the basics are:
    Transistor is just like a relay or vacuum tube. a switch that can be open or closed by applying electricity via a control wire.
    Transistors are Solid State!

    Today, computers use transistors that are smaller than 15 nanometers in size. (a sheet of paper is roughly 100,000 nanometers thick)
    They can switch states millions of times per second, and can run for decades.

"on" state - when electricity is flowing     = true
"off" state = when no electricity is flowing = false

"Boolean Algebra"! Logical Statements
"and" &&    -   "or" || -   "not" !
"XOR" - 'the only time an XOR statement is true is if ONE of the inputs is true (so when both = true, XOR = False"

Binary vs Decimal

8-bit
128 - 64 - 32 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1  === up to 255

8-bits are so common they have a special name. a "BYTE"

"MEGA" is a million bytes (MB)
"GIGA" is a billion bytes (GB)
"Tera" is a trillion bytes(TB) - " 8 trillion 1's and 0's "

32-bit - 4,294,967,295 = say 4.2 Billion or a range of + or - 2.1 Billion
64-bit - 9.2 Quintillion = 9,200,000,000,000,000,000

===
"FLOATING POINT" - IEEE STANDARDS -
'first bit is used for the sign of the number'
'next 8 bits are used for the exponent' - 10 ^ X
'remaining 23 used for the significant digits'

"ASCII" - 1963 - 7-bit digits ... turns into 8-bit
'a' - 97
'A' - 65 ... etc

"mojibake" - scrambled text
'different languages made a mess of ASCII standards'
  UNICODE - 1992
    one universal encoding scheme that uses (most commonly) 16-bits with space for over 1 million codes!
